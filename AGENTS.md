# ompgui - Development Notes

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run dev   # port 30178
```

Typecheck: `node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`  
Lint: `npm run lint`  
**Never run `next build` during dev** — pollutes `.next/` and breaks `npm run dev`.

The dev server needs the `omp` binary installed (on `PATH`, or set `OMP_WEB_OMP_BIN`).
All live-agent features go through it; session browsing works without it.

## Architecture

ompgui never imports `@oh-my-pi/*` or `@earendil-works/*` packages (they are
Bun-only and cannot run inside Node/Next). See `DESIGN.md` for the full porting
contract.

```

**Session browsing** (read-only): pure-Node parsing of omp session `.jsonl`
files via `lib/session-reader.ts` — no child process involved.  
**Sending a message**: `startRpcSession()` in `lib/rpc-manager.ts` spawns
`omp --mode rpc-ui` (one process per active session) through
`lib/omp/rpc-process.ts`.

Shared foundations in `lib/omp/`:

- `paths.ts` — Node port of omp's directory resolution (`~/.omp/agent`,
  profiles, XDG, session dir slugs).
- `omp-cli.ts` — locate/probe the installed `omp` binary (`resolveOmpBin`,
  `getOmpVersion`).
- `rpc-process.ts` — process + NDJSON protocol layer (`RpcProcess`).

## Key Design Decisions & Traps

### RPC session lifecycle (`lib/rpc-manager.ts`)
- One wrapper per session id, keyed in a `globalThis` registry.
- `globalThis` survives Next.js hot-reload; plain module-level Map does not.
- Idle sessions are disposed after a timeout; concurrent `startRpcSession()`
  calls must share a single start promise.

### Two kinds of branching — don't confuse them
- **Fork** (Fork button on user message): creates a new independent `.jsonl` file. Shown as a child in the sidebar tree via `parentSession` header field.
- **In-session branch** (Continue button / BranchNavigator): navigates the entry tree within the same file. Multiple entries share the same `parentId`. Switching between them calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### ToolCall field normalization
Sessions store toolCall blocks as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}` but `ToolCallContent` uses `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`. `normalizeToolCalls()` in `lib/normalize.ts` handles this — called in both `session-reader.ts` (file load) and streaming event handling.

### Event protocol differences vs pi
omp emits no `prompt_done` / `prompt_error` / `queue_update` /
`compaction_start` / `compaction_end` events. Completion is `agent_end`
(`isTerminal !== false`), errors surface as failed RPC responses plus `notice`
events, and the queue length comes from `get_state.queuedMessageCount`.
New frame types (`turn_start/end`, `notice`, `todo_reminder`, ...) must be
handled or safely ignored.

### Running state SSE + reconciliation
- The sidebar listens to `/api/agent/running/events`, backed by `subscribeRunningSessions()` in `lib/rpc-manager.ts`, so running badges update without polling.
- `useAgentSession` still treats per-session SSE as primary for chat events, but while a run is active it periodically calls `GET /api/agent/[id]` and also reconciles on `visibilitychange`/`online`. This fixes missed `agent_end` events from background tabs or half-open connections.
- Prompt runs use a monotonic run id; late SSE or slow reconciliation responses from an old run must be ignored so they cannot resurrect stale streaming bubbles.

### Composer-attached panels (`components/ComposerPanels.tsx`)
- The live todo plan (`TodoList`) and the subagent roster live **pinned above
  the chat input**, not inside the scrollable message list. `ComposerPanels`
  renders both, each independently collapsible via its header row (`chevron`);
  panels start collapsed (headers always show live progress / running-summary).
  Subagent chips carry live state (pulsing dot while `started`, check/alert/ban
  for terminal states) fed by the same `subagent_lifecycle`/`subagent_progress`
  SSE frames; clicking a chip opens the transcript dialog. `TodoList` keeps a
  non-collapsible default (`collapsible` prop) for SSR tests.

### Subagent integration (`lib/subagent-types.ts`, `lib/subagent-history.ts`)
- **Live detail**: `subagent_progress` frames carry the full `AgentProgress`
  object — `lib/subagent-types.ts` parses it defensively into
  `SubagentInfo.progress` (current tool/intent, tokens, cost, context
  gauge, resolved model, retry state, detached flag, agentSource). The
  composer chips surface the current activity + telemetry line; retry
  (`⟳ retrying N/M`) takes precedence over the tool line. `subagent_event`
  frames also feed a bounded per-subagent activity buffer shown in the
  transcript dialog.
- **Roster hydration**: `get_subagents` snapshots (which carry progress)
  rehydrate the roster after SSE reconnect (`refreshSubagentRoster`, wired
  into mount, send, and the reconcile poll). Terminal subagents vanish from
  the RPC registry — history fills that gap.
- **On-disk history** (`lib/subagent-history.ts`, `/api/sessions/[id]/subagents*`):
  omp persists each subagent's transcript to the parent session's sibling
  artifacts dir (`<session-dir>/<subagent-id>.jsonl`) and the parent file's
  task toolResults keep `progress[]`/`results[]` snapshots. ompgui recovers
  the roster from disk (`extractSubagentHistory`, result fields win over the
  mid-run snapshot), so past/finished runs show in the composer panel after a
  reload. The transcript route pages the sibling file byte-wise (mirroring
  `get_subagent_messages`, which is RPC-registry-gated and refuses files it
  doesn't know). The dialog reads only the final output — `<id>.md` via
  `?mode=completion` (bounded tail read that also works for transcripts
  beyond the 16MB paging cap) with a live `get_subagents` snapshot fallback
  for header enrichment; it never pages the raw transcript. Subagent ids are
  `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,80}` — the route validates before joining to confine reads
  to the sibling dir.
- **In-message task summary** (`components/MessageView.tsx` TaskResultPanel):
  the session reader allowlists a SIZE-BOUNDED subset of `task` toolResult
  details (telemetry only — no `output`/`stderr`, long text truncated to
  240 chars, `lib/session-reader.ts` `keepTaskToolResultDetails`), and
  expanded `task` tool calls render a per-subagent summary (status, agent,
  task, tokens/cost/duration/model, async marker) above the raw result text.
- **Chip extras**: agent-source labels (`user`/`project`), nested-subagent
  count (`inflightTaskDetails`/`extractedToolData.task` progress), and the
  `⤴` async marker (live `detached` flag or history `details.async`
  presence). Shared formatters live in `lib/subagent-format.ts`.

### Worktrees and project grouping
- `lib/worktree.ts` resolves linked worktree top-levels back to the main repo `projectRoot`; `listAllSessions()` attaches that to each `SessionInfo` so all worktrees for one repo are grouped together in the sidebar.
- Worktree operations are served by `/api/worktrees` and guarded by the same allowed-root rules as `/api/files`.
- New worktrees are created under `<repoRoot>-worktrees/<sanitized-branch>`. Existing branches are reused; otherwise `git worktree add -b` creates the branch.
- Removing a dirty worktree returns `409` with `{ dirty: true }` so the UI can ask before retrying with `force`.
- Sessions whose cwd points at a removed worktree are inferred back into the main project instead of becoming a phantom project row.

### Managed projects sidebar (`lib/project-registry.ts`, `/api/projects`)
- The sidebar lists **managed projects**: explicitly added directories (registered in
  `~/.omp/agent/projects.json`, written atomically as temp-file + rename) plus
  session-discovered ones — hidden entries excluded. Removing a project only
  marks it hidden (reversible via re-adding); hidden entries suppress session
  re-discovery.
- Registry paths are canonical `projectRoot`s: `POST` resolves worktrees to
  their main repo via `resolveProject`, and `resolveProject` returns the
  symlink-free on-disk form for plain directories so registered and
  session-discovered paths compare equal on Windows casing.
- `GET /api/projects` re-authorizes registered roots with `allowFileRoot()` —
  the in-memory browse allowlist does not survive restarts, and empty managed
  projects derive no root from sessions.
- The client sorts the merged list by most-recently-added (registration
  order), then by path for session-discovered projects
  (`lib/project-ordering.ts`); the order deliberately does NOT depend on
  session activity, so project rows never jump around while sessions refresh.
  Expanded project paths live
  in `localStorage` (`ompgui:expanded-projects`), defaulting to only the
  active/restored project expanded, and stale keys are pruned against the
  current project list (only after the first project fetch — an empty
  still-loading list must never wipe storage).
- Each project's session tree is capped at 5 roots with a show-more toggle;
  project rows are cards matching the session items' height/margins/accent
  treatment, and the active project's worktree selector renders directly
  below its row.

### File access allow-list
- `/api/files` is intentionally not a general filesystem browser. Allowed roots come from session cwds, their resolved project roots, `~/omp-cwd-*`, and roots explicitly added with `allowFileRoot()`.
- `/api/cwd/validate`, `/api/default-cwd`, and `/api/worktrees` call `allowFileRoot()` when they make a new location browsable.

### Session list caching — new sessions must appear immediately
- `listAllSessions()` (sidebar, command palette) is cached twice: a 30s TTL
  list cache in `lib/session-reader.ts` plus an mtime-keyed directory walk in
  `lib/omp/session-files.ts` (`listSessionFiles`).
- The walk cache keys on the **sessions root** mtime. On Windows/NTFS a new
  `.jsonl` inside an existing project subdirectory does NOT bump the root
  mtime, so the walk stays stale indefinitely.
- `invalidateSessionListCache()` (fired on `agent_end`, `session_info_update`,
  compaction, renames) must therefore ALSO clear the walk cache via
  `invalidateSessionFileListCache()` — never add a session-mutation path that
  forgets this. Regression test: `session-reader.test.mjs`.

### Chat scroll-follow
- `useAgentSession` follows the conversation: the effect depends on both
  `messages` (boundaries) and `streamState` (every token batch) and throttles
  to one `requestAnimationFrame` while a run is active (`followScrollFrameRef`).
- A manual scroll-up sets `completionScrollAllowedRef = false` and disables
  following until the next prompt; `scrollUserMsgToTop` handles the
  pending-scroll after sending.
- Programmatic smooth scrolling must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
  (`usePrefersReducedMotion` in `hooks/usePrefersReducedMotion.ts` — also the
  only way to stop SVG SMIL animations, which CSS cannot).

### MCP configuration (`lib/omp/mcp-config.ts`, `/api/mcp`, `components/McpConfig.tsx`)
- Project MCP config resolution order: `.omp/mcp.json`, `.omp/.mcp.json`,
  `mcp.json`, `.mcp.json` at the git top level (falls back to cwd for
  non-git dirs). Server definitions support `stdio`, `http`, and `sse`;
  exactly one of `command`/`url` is required and validated before any write.
- Writes are atomic (temp file + rename), preserve unrelated top-level keys
  (`disabledServers`, `$schema`, ...), and support rename via `previousName`.
- The MCP settings live in their own Settings tab (`SettingsTabs` id `"mcp"`,
  workspace-gated). Server list rows show a config-derived status dot
  (valid+enabled / disabled / invalid) — no live-connectivity probe exists in
  the RPC protocol, so failures surface as toasts (`toast.error`) from the
  editor actions, not inline text.
- The endpoint is guarded by the same allowed-root rules as `/api/files`.

### Plugins and skills
- `/api/plugins` shells out to the user's `omp plugin` CLI (`list/install/uninstall/enable/disable/upgrade`, `--json` where available) — never the Bun-only SDK.
- `/api/skills` uses `lib/skills-service.ts`, a pure-Node scanner mirroring omp's discovery order: project `.omp/skills` (walk-up), `~/.omp/agent/skills`, then the `.claude` / `.agent(s)` / `.codex` / `.github` compat dirs and managed skills.
- Skill toggling edits only the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter key on the target `SKILL.md`; keep that surgical so user formatting survives.
- `/api/skills/install` shells through `npx skills add ... --agent universal`, which installs into the ecosystem-standard `.agents/skills` dirs omp reads; project installs run with the selected cwd.
